# Geomagnetic Cutoff

## What is it?

- a quantitative measure to determine which particle trajectories are allowed or forbidden

  - usually done by observing the rigidity of the particle
  - rigidity : the momentum per charge of the particle

## Algorithm

- [ ] Chooses a single type of particle

  - for our sake, this would be a proton
  - for now, this can and will be changed in the near future
  - We should implement this so that the particle type can be changed easily (like some user input)

- [ ] Choose some location

  - [ ] Kamioka : where the Super-Kamiokande is

    - 36.434800, 137.276599 (in decimal degree notation)
    - 36째26'05.3"N 137째16'35.8"E (in decimal minute second (DMS) notation)

  - [ ] South Pole : where IceCube is

    - 89.99 -63.453056 (decimal notation)
    - 89째 59' 24", -63째 27' 11" (in DMS)

  - we could implement this for more locations later on

  - To make this easier, we could store this data in some dictionary

- [ ] Choose some energy for the particle

  - Test the waters
  - ~0.5GeV (low energy limit), ~1GeV, ~10GeV, ~100GeV should be good enough for now.
  - We should make a functionality where we can add more energies with ease when higher energies are supported

- [ ] get the trajectories for each zenith and azimuthal angle

  - we want to start from high zenith angles to lower ones (higher zenith angle should be more allowed than lower zenith angle)

    - for azimuthal it doesnt really matter all that much

  - we need to have a way to convert the provided trajectory in longitude, latitude, altitude, zenith, and azimuth angle to spherical

  - currently we only have this for longitude, latitude, and altitude so we need this for zenith and azimuth as well

    - To do this, we can retain our current version or add on to it

  - Probably have to implement a double for-loop for this (for each zenith angle, for each azimuth angle)

- [ ] In the end, we want to have a checking condition whether the particle can be a cosmic ray or not

  - this can be done by seeing if the particle touched the Earth sometime within its trajectory
  - Also seen when the particle has looped at least twice around the Earth

    - if there are 2 occurrances of the same longitude or latitude a total of 2 times

  - Other conditions may be needed, not sure what they would be

    - Either way we can integrate that on a later date, focus on those above for now.

  - we also want to return the rigidity of each **initial** trajectory, which will help us determnine the cutoff value for the rigidity as well

    - this will provide the quantitative measure for the geomagnetic cutoff

- [ ] With the result (True of False), we can plot a 2-d heatmap

  - zenith and azimuth angles on each axis, and yes / no as the color axis
  - the title should specify the location and altitude and the particle type and energy
  - store it as a .png file for now, we can think of a better storage method later on

## Implementation

- create a new file that does all of the above

  - alternatively we can make this into a member function of the ParticleTrajectory class
  - But just to keep things separate for now, I think its better to make it its own file

    - we can always integrate it as a member function later on if we want to

- small things like conversions will be in the utility class like always

- we should also have a new file that can create a dictionary of locations based on longitude and latitude -

### Implementing the zenith and azimuthal angles

After drawing some geometrical figures, I think I have the equation to properly convert a 3-D vector ($s, \xi, \alpha$) defined on the local reference frame (sphere) to the geocentric coordinates ($r, \theta, \phi$) (given initial geocentric coordinates ($r_0, \theta_0, \phi_0$).)

Some definitions of the variables:

- $l$ is the altitude along the zenith from the tangent plane
- $\xi$ is the zenith angle defined locally
- $\alpha$ is the azimuthal angle defined locally
- ($r_0, \theta_0, \phi_0$) defines the location of the detector _after_ conversion from longitude and latitude coordinates to geocentric ones

  - $r_0$ here represents the Earth's radius

- ($r, \theta, \phi$) are our usual spherical coordinate system that will be used for the integration process

With these definitions, we have our conversion equation as follows:

- $(r \cos\phi)^2 = (r_0 \cos \phi_0)^2 + \left( \dfrac{l\cos\alpha}{\cos z}\right)^2 - 2r_0l \cos \alpha\cos\phi_0$

  - derived from Law of Cosines with the projection of the vectors onto the $(r, \theta)$-plane.

- $\theta = \theta_0 - \left(\dfrac{-l\cos \alpha \tan z}{r \cos \phi}\right)$

  - derived from Law of Sines and simpler triangle properties

- $\phi = \phi_o - \arctan \left(\dfrac{l\tan z \cos\alpha}{r_0\tan\theta_0}\right)$

  - derived from projection of 3-vector in local frame onto tangent plane with projection of tangent plane onto the $(r, \phi)$-plane
  - we observed that the tanget plane is at a right angle to the initial vector, and as such transforming the projected vector on the tanget plane to the Cartesian axes was not too hard.

So only $\phi$ can be evaluated completely using the variables provided. The other two variables $r, \theta$ must be evaluated from $\phi$. So we want to evaluate the coordinates like this:

1. Get ($r_0, \theta_0, \phi_0$) from our already existing conversion code for latitude and longitude to geocentric coordinates
2. Get $\phi$ from above
3. Evaluate for $r \cos\phi$ from the first equation
4. Use the results from 3\. to determine $\theta$
5. Divide the results from 3\. by $\cos \phi$ to get $r$.

Hopefully this allows a perfect conversion...

### Current issues

- [ ] There should be a way to check each trajectory point to get a boolean yes or no for allowed / forbidden trajectories

  - My idea is to either:

    - Remove zenith and azimuthal angles as members of the TrajectoryPoint class and make some converter from horizontal coordinates to geodesic ones with zenith and azimuth as arguments

      - most promising one right now

  - remove those guys as members and create a new class that contains the trajectorypoint along with zenith and azimuthal

  - Leave them as members and create the converter within the class

    - least configuration necessary
